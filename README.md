# How to use

This is a CLI application, so you need to open a terminal and use it from there.

## Install

At the moment it is available only as a portable version and the installation process is not too complex:

1. Download the latest version [from here](https://github.com/Relepega/PythonVersionManager/releases).
2. Unzip the app where you won't move it never again until you uninstall it.
3. Inside the app folder, go to the subfolder `scripts`, right-click on `install.bat` and then click on `Run as administrator`. If the UAC kicks in, please click on `yes`.
4. Wait until you don't see any flying terminal and then close the folder.
5. Restart your terminal.
6. Type `pvm -h` and press enter. If the installation was successful then you will see an output like in [this image](#python-version-manager).
7. Profit ðŸŽ‰!

Please keep in mind that you must install the app for each user you want to use it with. 

## Uninstall

It's basically the same process as the installation one:

1. Open the app folder.
2. Go to the `scripts` subfolder, right-click on `uninstall.bat` and then click on `Run as administrator`. If the UAC kicks in, please click on `yes`.
3. Wait until you don't see any flying terminal and then close the folder.
4. Restart your terminal.
5. Type `pvm -h` and press enter. If pvm was uninstalled successfully now in the terminal you should see an error.
6. Profit ðŸŽ‰!
7. (optional) Please let me know why you decided to uninstall pvm: fill [this form](https://github.com/Relepega/PythonVersionManager/issues/new) and i'll be here to read your struggles with pvm.

Please keep in mind that you must uninstall the app for each user you want to use it with. 

## Commands

The options you can use are: `list`, `install`, `uninstall`, `reinstall`, `use`, `--help`

Here's a description of each command:

### `list` (or the alias `l`)

Displays the requested info to the user.

`$ pvm list latest` lists all the latest python releases.

`$ pvm list all` lists all the available python versions.

`$ pvm list installed` lists all the currently installed versions.

### `install` (or the alias `i`)

Installs the requested version. If you type the wrong version nothing will happen.

`$ pvm install latest` Installs the latest stable python version (currently it is 3.11.3).

`$ pvm install 3.11.0` Installs python 3.11.0.

### `uninstall` (or the alias `u`)

Uninstalls the specified version. If you type the wrong version nothing will happen.

`$ pvm uninstall all` Uninstalls ALL the installed python versions. Be careful with this one...

`$ pvm uninstall 3.11.0` Unistalls python 3.11.0.

### `reinstall` (or the alias `r`)

Uninstalls and then installs the specified version again. If you type the wrong version nothing will happen.

`$ pvm reinstall all` Reinstalls ALL the installed python versions.

`$ pvm reinstall 3.11.0` Reinstalls python 3.11.0.

### `use`

No alias for this one.

If already downloaded, it activates the requested version.

`$ pvm use 3.11.0`

### `--help` (or the alias `-h`)

Basically shows in the console what is written here. You can see it in action in the image [here](#python-version-manager).

# Developing

Any type of contribution is well accepted, just create a PR and i'll review it as soon as possible!

## Get started

First of all, check if you have all the tools needed to run the software installed:

- Python 3.8.x or higher (actually this project has been written and tested with python 3.11.2)
- Pip3
- Git
- Visual C++ Redist
- Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 Build Tools
  - download the installer [from here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and then install the required tools with this command: `$ vs_buildtools.exe --norestart --passive --downloadThenInstall --includeRecommended --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.MSBuildTools`

When you're sure that you have installed them correctly, proceed by cloning the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Relepega/PythonVersionManager.git`

Once you've cloned the repo, cd into the directory and install the required python packages:

`$ cd PythonVersionManager && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You're now ready to go!
If you want to build from source because you don't trust some random guy on the internet, run the build script:
`build.bat`

or do it manually:

`$ python setup.py build`

# FAQ

Q: Why reinvent the wheel when [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) exists and does the same thing?

A: Forgive my ignorance, but i didn't know of its existence until the creation of this project.
